        <h4 class="title is-4">Information We Collect</h4>
        <h5 class="title is-5">1. Personal Information</h5>
        <p>
            We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII).
        </p>
        <h5 class="title is-5">2. Automatically Collected Information</h5>
        <p>
            We avoid invasive data collection. However:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Anonymized Data: Some data such as IP addresses or user agent strings may be collected, but only in
                anonymized form and not linked to individuals.
            </li>
            <li>
                Minimal Logging: We retain basic logs to ensure system integrity and security. These are not used for
                behavioral profiling or analytics.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="title is-5">3. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h5>
        <p>
            We use only essential cookies required for site functionality. For more details, see our <a
                href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <h5 class="title is-5">4. ATProtocol Network Information</h5>
        <p>
            Smoke Signal interacts with the ATProtocol network to provide its features. This includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Authentication and identity resolution</li>
            <li>Event creation, modification, and linking</li>
            <li>RSVP creation and modification</li>
            <li>Discovery of public events and user identities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Smoke Signal also makes outbound requests to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolve DID documents</li>
            <li>Connect to service endpoints (e.g. Personal Data Servers)</li>
            <li>Read and write records to external PDS instances</li>
            <li>Discovery of public events and user identities</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Smoke Signal maintains an index of publicly available data but is not the source of truth for event or RSVP
            records.

            We may share limited information under these conditions:

        <ul>
            <li>Service Providers: Only as necessary to deliver the Site (e.g., hosting providers)</li>

        <h4 class="title is-4">Your Rights and Choices</h4>
        <h5 class="title is-5">1. Access and Correction</h5>
        <p>
            We do not collect personal data, so there is nothing to access or correct.
        </p>
        <h5 class="title is-5">2. Data Deletion</h5>
        <p>
            You may request the deletion of data we index. However, since Smoke Signal reflects public records stored on
            external servers, full removal may require action at the PDS level.
        </p>
        <h5 class="title is-5">3. Do Not Track</h5>
        <p>
            We honor Do Not Track (DNT) signals and do not use tracking technologies.

        <h4 class="title is-4">Data Security and Retention</h4>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable safeguards to protect the data we process. However, no system is 100% secure. Data
            is retained only as long as needed for functionality or required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: ATProtocol is a public data protocol. There is no privacy mechanism in the protocol itself for hiding
            event or RSVP data. Smoke Signal reflects that architecture and cannot offer private storage.
